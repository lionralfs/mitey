A CLI Tool for [mite](https://mite.yo.lk/). (‚ö†Ô∏è This is still a work in progress!)

## Requirements
You must have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/) (v6 or higher) and
[`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed to run mitey.

Before you start, you need to generate an API key for your account.

- Go to your mite settings (*https://\<your-team>.mite.yo.lk/myself*)
- Select *Allow API access*,
- Click *Display API key* and copy your key.

## Installation
- Run `npm install -g mitey` to install mitey globally.
- Run `mitey init`.
	- Enter your team name. It is this part: **\<your-team>**.mite.yo.lk
	- Enter your API key
	- Enter a time in minutes that you want your time entries to be rounded up to. Leave it empty if you don't want to modify your time entries.
- Run `mitey verify` to check if everything was set up correctly.

## Usage

### Starting a new tracker
- `mitey start` will walk you through a process to create a new time entry. It will ask you to specify a *customer*, *project* and *service*. You can also provide a *note*.

### Stopping the tracker
- `mitey stop` will try to stop the current tracker, if there is one.

### Viewing the current tracker
